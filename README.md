# Elevators-Pitch

Hello, my name is Amaan Hashmi-Ubhi and I've recently graduated with a BSc in Biomedical Science from the University of Birmingham, where I undertook a year in computer science. I have been using Linux for around 4 years, 3 of those exclusively and have found that my interests lean towards computing rather than medical research, mainly because I learn and practice from home. I have built my PC with which use Arch Linux and Fedora Server Edition on my server running off an old laptop, of which I run BOINC, seed Linux distributions and use as a remote backup; with many projects to come. My skills currently focus on the operations side of computing, though I am interested in DevOps because of the variety of tools that are used as well as how fast the field appears to be moving, and I am always interested in learning more. Additionally, I have developed a variety of soft skills such as conflict resolution throughout my university career due to obtaining leadership roles as treasurer and chair in Kung Fu and the CTO in the Medical Research Society.
