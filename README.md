# Elevators-Pitch

Hello, my name is Amaan Hashmi-Ubhi and I've recently graduated with a BSc in Biomedical Science from the University of Birmingham, where I undertook a year in computer science. I have been using Linux for around 4 years, 3 of those exclusively and have found that my interests lean towards computing rather than medical research, mainly because I can learn and practice from home which is not currently possible in medical research. I have built my PC with which use Arch Linux and Fedora Server Edition on my server running off an old laptop, of which I run BOINC, seed Linux distributions and use as a remote backup; with many projects to come. My skills currently focus on the operations side of computing, though I am interested in DevOps because of the variety of tools that are used as well as how fast the field appears to be moving, and I am always interested in learning more. Additionally, I have developed a variety of soft skills such as conflict resolution and decision making throughout my university career due to obtaining leadership roles as treasurer, chair and teaching assisstant in a Kung Fu Society and the CTO in the Birmingham Medical Research Society.


* Highlight benefits of Arch Linux and why I have done that
* Maybe why chose Fedora Server Edition, to learn RedHat distros as is common in the industry
* Some pauses
* Explain more about why DevOps
* Check for spelling errors
